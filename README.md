# 🧠 BlogLabs — Maximizing Creativity while Sharing Knowledge

Welcome to **BlogLabs** — my slightly chaotic but fully awesome attempt to make sharing blogs in a creative and techy manner.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build), this project is part terminal simulation, part rich visual UI (in progress), and all heart. 
First time using Astro so expect glitches here and there.

From long time I wanted to share my knowledge on top tier platforms like `Linkedin` but not just in simple article fashion like any other blog,but rather something more, something creative and fun to read, hence the need of **BlogLabs** arose.

Terminal fans like me want to do things fast (though not everything ;) but also feel the need of experincing the fancy animations and visually enriched experience, so why stick to a single thing when you can move between the 2 realms at your own whim.

Presenting to you **BLOGLABS**!

Its not just a simple blogging site but an effort to merge the Portfolio with the wisdom.

After all sharing is caring and wiser the person better the take on life. {late night thoughts}

```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` and you're live.

## Interface (Minimal vs Rich)

* **Minimal Blog Experience** — heavily terminal-inspired UI for the techy world.
* **Rich Blog Experience** — still in progress, think ✨ clean UI, tags, filters, animation, maybe even 3D someday.

Switch between them? You bet.

The Initial Screen is inspired from [GRUB Bootloader](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/). Similar like it helps in selection of which OS to boot, here it helps in booting the realm you want.

## Interface Philosophy
Being a core OS & System Lover, i wanted to acheive a web interface that make me feel like i am actually using the system itself.
Hence the minimal (terminal) & the Rich (desktop) experience.

The **Minimal** Interface is designed to reduce the time in interaction and maximize the time to learning & reading.
The **Rich** Interface is been planned to include as many as modern animations and visual elements to make the reading a breeze.

The Rich Blog Experience is planned to contain a desktop like feel (shh...i should stop giving spoiler and should start working ahead on this T_T).

## ✍️ Write Your Own Blog (Yes, You!)

Yup, BlogLabs is kind of my portfolio, but its more than just a simple portfolio showcasing what all i know, what all i have done. It represents the core feelings of mine, which is to never stop learning.

BlogLabs is open for community blogs. Wanna flex your knowledge, rant about Linux, or share that Aha! moment of yours.

Here’s how to contribute:

### 🛠 Option 1: Pull Request (for devs)

1. Fork this repo and create a new branch.

2. Add your `.md` blog file under:

   ```
   src/content/blogs/your-cool-title.md
   ```

3. Use this frontmatter at the top:

   ```md
   ---
   title: "Your Blog Title"
   author: "Your Name"
   date: "2025-06-12"
   summary: "Short summary of your blog (20-30 words)"
   ---
   lorem ipsum.....
   ```

4. Open a pull request.

5. Wait for the next scheduled deployment (details below 👇).

<!-- ### 🧑‍🚀 Option 2: Google Form Submission (non-devs or lazy devs)

Auto PR generation :) -->

<!-- ## 🕰 Deployment Schedule & Publishing Logic

BlogLabs is hosted at: **[blog-labs.vercel.app](https://blog-labs.vercel.app)**

### ⏳ Deployment Frequency:

* **Alternate Days** — 00:00 UTC (every second day)
* During this window, the site may go into maintenance briefly. -->

### 🚨 Heads-up:

* **This is a static site**, which means adding blogs triggers a full rebuild.
* Your blog may take some time to appear depending on when it was merged.
* As BlogLabs grows, smarter deployment (ISR, CMS) will be added — for now, this is what it is.

<!-- ## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

I wanted to build something **weirdly cool**, functional, and extensible — a platform where I and others can write, learn, teach, and just vibe with dev stuff.

BlogLabs is part of my ongoing dev journey — a side project turned into a public lab.
If you're building cool things or want to share thoughts, you're already welcome here. -->
