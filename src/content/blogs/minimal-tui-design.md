summary: "Exploring the principles behind effective Text User Interfaces (TUIs) for maximum efficiency and a truly keyboard-driven experience."

Text User Interfaces (TUIs) prioritize function over form, delivering information directly without the overhead of graphical elements. They are highly efficient, keyboard-driven, and often evoke a nostalgic, powerful computing experience.

Building a TUI requires careful consideration of navigation flow and contextual information. Unlike a CLI, which interprets direct commands, a TUI often presents a menu or list that users navigate with directional keys.

The goal is to provide a rich experience through text alone, using simple characters to convey structure and interaction. This ensures blazing fast loading times and minimal resource usage, making it ideal for a "terminal class textual" website.
