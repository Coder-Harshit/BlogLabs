Astro is a modern static site builder that focuses on delivering incredible performance by shipping zero JavaScript to the browser by default. It allows you to use your favorite UI frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, but only hydrates the interactive parts. This makes it perfect for content-heavy websites like blogs and portfolios, where speed and SEO are paramount.

Key features include:
- Islands Architecture
- UI Framework Agnostic
- Fast by default
- SEO friendly

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import react from '@astrojs/react';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [react()]
});
```

Here's an example of HTML within a code block:
```html
<!-- src/pages/index.astro -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Astro Site</title>
</head>
<body>
    <MyComponent client:load />
</body>
</html>
